# Orderable Questions

## Installation

1. Simply drop this into your WordPress __plugins__ folder
2. Activate the plugin from within WordPress

## What does it do?

It adds a new question type to your e-learning website that requires users to drag and drop a list of things into the correct order.

### Why?

The [Train-Up!](wptrainup.co.uk) e-learning plugin for WordPress adds a training section to any WordPress website. 

The plugin itself comes with Multiple Choice and Single-answer questions built-in. Other question types such as this one can be added on separately.
